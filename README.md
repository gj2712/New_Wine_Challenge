Step1 : Training my own custom object detector on google colab.

For custom training of yolo we need to make changes in its make file and cfg file

Step2 : After training it, I saved the weights and used them in the program.                                                         
main.py file contains the program                                                      
The program is detecting the grapes in the images and printing the no. of objects detected in the particular image

Predictions are made on the test dataset(file names are provided on the test_name file)                              
In this repo I have added the main program file and the predicted outputs which is inside the prediction folder.                                                  
If you want to see the custom data and weights file than that is available on the drive.
